## Requirements

*For team assignment, only 1 member in the team should fork the repo. Then, admin can invite other members to contribute in the same repo. Remember to have develop branch before merging to main. And each feature/schema/bug/issue should have it's own branch, and taken by only 1 member. Before making any new branch, make sure you run `git pull` to avoid the conflicts with the remote repo.*
